# - wave_N_delay: Delay before wave starts (seconds)
# - wave_N_count: Number of enemies in wave (for discrete waves) or max concurrent (for continuous)
# - wave_N_enemy: Single enemy type to spawn
# - wave_N_enemies: Array of enemy types to randomly select from (adds variety!)
# - wave_N_interval: Spawn interval between enemies (default 0.5s for discrete, 1.0s for continuous)
# - wave_N_interval_variance: Random variance in spawn timing (adds unpredictability!)
# - wave_N_position_variance: Random Y-position variance in pixels (default 50.0)
# - wave_N_continuous: true = spawn forever, false = spawn once then done (default false)
